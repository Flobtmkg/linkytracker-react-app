BUILD REACT WEB BUNDLE :
------------------------

	- npx expo export:web

DOCKER BUILD :
--------------

	- As we need to create an image that can be used for testing and production on potentially different processor architectures (for exemple to run on a rasberry PI) we need to use a multi-arch builder. You can create one with the command "docker buildx create --name multi-arch-builder --use --bootstrap". A new builder called multi-arch-builder will be created and will be used as default. It will download and use moby/buildkit as a dependency in order to build multi-architectures images.
	
	- Since the react app is bundled we can build the docker image :
		Command (that push to remote) : docker buildx build --push --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --tag *yourepo*/linkyreactapp:latest .

DOCKER RUN :
------------

	- To launch container (on port 81 here) :

		docker run -p 81:80 *yourepo*/linkyreactapp:latest
